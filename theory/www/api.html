The keyword interface is what better describes what an API is, an interface that a software program presents to other 
programs (Jin et. al., 2018). In other words, an API provides a common ground for one piece of software to talk to 
another piece of software running on another machine (Anuff, 2017). APIs are building blocks that allow the communication 
and interaction between systems for major business platforms on the web (Jin et. al., 2018) once they facilitate the 
interaction between those different software programs and access to their services (Dongo et. al., 2021).

An API paradigm defines the interface exposing the backend data of a service to other applications (Jin et. al., 2018). 
Within this context, Request-Response APIs expose an interface through an HTTP-based web server with three common 
paradigms: REST (Representational State Transfer), RPC, and GraphQL (Jin et. al., 2018). REST is the most popular 
choice for API development and the one we will explore a bit.
<br><br>
REST APIs are all about resources; they handle data as resources and use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to 
perform operations. In practice, operating through the Request-Response cycle, the client makes HTTP requests to the Server 
that returns responses, typically in JSON or XML format. Our program is called the client, and the web server is called 
the server. Another relevant concept is Endpoints, which are specific URLs that the client applications use to access 
the resources of a web service (source: https://realpython.com/api-integration-in-python/#api-endpoints).

Once a REST API receives and processes an HTTP request, it will return an HTTP response 
that includes a status code, indicating the success or failure of the request. The full list of possible HTTP errors 
is defined by the *Internet Engineering Task Force* and is available at https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6. 
The Standard status code is:
<ul>
    <li><b>2XX</b> range indicates success.</li>
    <li><b>3XX</b> codes indicate a resource has moved.</li>
    <li><b>4XX</b> range indicates a client-side error (like a missing required parameter or too many requests).</li>
    <li><b>5XX</b> range indicates server-side errors.</li>
</ul>
