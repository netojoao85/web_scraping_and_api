When web scraping, it is a good idea to insert pauses between downloading web pages, as this helps spread out the traffic to the website. Web scrapers may be 
banned from a website if they put undue stress on it (Bradley & James, 2019).

Should make download requests at a reasonable rate (Jarmul & Lawson, 2017). Should be aware that requesting a page multiple times in 
rapid succession can be seen as suspicious, or even malicious, use of a website (Eswari et. al., 2022).

Define a user agent to identify our crawler (Jarmul & Lawson, 2017). The 'User-Agent' is an important request header, because the server looks into 
it to find out what kind of program is accessing its contents (browser versus a robot), eventually differentiating user responses (Glez-Pe√±a et. al., 2013).

Reviewing the Terms of Service of the site and ensuring the data taken is not considered private or copyrighted are good practices to consider and 
avoid legal actions against us (Jarmul & Lawson, 2017).
