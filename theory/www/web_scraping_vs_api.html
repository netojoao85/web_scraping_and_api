In an ideal world, web scraping wouldn't be necessary, and each website would provide an API (Jarmul & Lawson, 2017) to share 
their data in a structured format (Dongo et. al., 2021). APIs are designed to provide a convenient stream of well-formatted 
data from one computer program to another (Mitchell, 2018), but although some websites do provide APIs, they typically 
restrict the data that is available and the frequency it can be accessed (Jarmul & Lawson, 2017, Dongo et. al., 2021). 
Additionally, website developers might change, remove, or restrict the backend API (Jarmul & Lawson, 2017).
<br> <br> 
On the opposite of web scraping, which is affected by webpage changes, APIs are independent of the information displayed on 
the website (Dongo et. al., 2021), turning APIs fantastic if you find one that suits your purposes (Mitchell, 2018). Web 
scraping is more flexible than API extraction once it is not restricted to the information that 
APIs offer (Dongo et. al., 2021).
<br> <br> 
Regarding cost and rate limit, extracting data using API is not free and has a limit (Dongo et. al., 2021) while with 
web scraping the costs linked are to the application development to parse and extract the data (Hillen, 2019). Although 
web scraping does not have a defined rate limit, it makes the website traffic spike and may cause the breakdown of the 
website server (Eswari et. al., 2022), so is a good practice to make download requests at a reasonable 
rate (Jarmul & Lawson, 2017) to spread out the traffic to the website.
<br> <br> 
In general, it is preferable to use an API (if one exists), rather than build a bot to get the same data. However, according 
to Mitchell (2018) an API might not exist or be useful for your purposes, for several reasons: 
<ul>
    <li>You are gathering relatively small, finite sets of data across a large collection of websites without a cohesive API.</li>
    <li>The source does not have the infrastructure or technical ability to create an API.</li>
    <li>The data you want is fairly small or uncommon, and the creator did not think it warranted an API.</li>
    <li>The data is valuable and/or protected and not intended to be spread widely. </li>
</ul>

Even when an API does exist, the request volume and rate limits, the types of data, or the 
format of data that it provides might be insufficient for your purposes, this is where web scraping steps in.
