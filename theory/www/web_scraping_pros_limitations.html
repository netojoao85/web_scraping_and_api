<b>Pros</b>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Low costs:</b> Good datasets can be expensive. Using web scraping is free for some cases where policies allow 
        it (Dongo et. al. 2021). The costs associated are the time required to write and test the code (Hillen, 2019).
    </li>
</ul>

<b>Limitations</b>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>No historic data:</b> Web scraping means collecting real-time data; hence, it is not able to access historical 
        data. To come up with a sufficiently long time series, one needs to start data collection from day zero of the 
        respective period, requiring careful planning ahead (Hillen, 2019).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Network speed:</b> The network speed may affect when and how the data is displayed (Glez-Peña et al., 2013), 
        and can affect the data extraction when the page is not displayed (Dongo et. al., 2021).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Ongoing maintenance:</b> Every website has a different structure which involves site-specific 
        programming (Eswari et. al., 2022, Glez-Peña et al., 2013). Due to the website changes, the scripts developed must 
        be updated to the new format or layout of the information (Dongo et. al., 2021, Glez-Peña et al., 2013). Although some 
        code elements are helpful as building blocks, there is always a need to adapt the script, depending on how the website 
        is set up, the page structure, authentication requirements, etc., because many websites use reactive elements, simple 
        HTTP requests cannot be used (Hillen, 2019).
