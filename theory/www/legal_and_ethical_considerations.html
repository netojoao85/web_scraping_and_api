Web scraping itself is a technology and is not per se illegal or legal, however, legal constraints and ethical concerns can and need to be 
debated (Hillen, 2019).
<br><br>
How to deal with web scraping is still subject to discussion in the legal literature and the law is still evolving (Hillen, 2019), despite numerous 
rulings over the past two decades (Jarmul & Lawson, 2017). In any case, when scraping from a website, we are the guests and need to behave politely 
otherwise, the IP address may be banned or could suffer legal actions (Jarmul & Lawson, 2017). There is no difference between visiting or scraping a 
website, in both cases, the user is a guest and thus, is not the owner of the data extracted (Glez-Pe√±a et al., 2013).
<br><br>
Only public content should be accessed, and copyright policies must be complied with (Hillen, 2019). Should also be taken measures to review the Terms 
of Service of the site (Jarmul & Lawson, 2017). A general rule of thumb, any information stored behind a username and password is considered private and 
ought not to be web-scraped (Bradley & James, 2019). Large websites require user registration often and can detect scrapers (Hillen, 2019).
<br><br>
If the scraped data is being used for personal and private use, and within fair use of copyright laws, there is usually no problem. However, if the data 
is going to be republished, if the scraping is aggressive enough to take down the site, or if the content is copyrighted and the scraper violates the terms 
of service, then there are several legal precedents to note (Jarmul & Lawson, 2017).
<br><br>
Jarmul & Lawson (2017) analysed various cases involving companies, having suggested that when the scraped data constitutes public facts (such as business 
locations and telephone listings), it can be republished following fair use rules. However, if the data is original (such as opinions and reviews or private 
user data), it most likely cannot be republished for copyright reasons.
<br><br>
In the end, and case of doubts, the best practice is certainly to obtain the explicit permission of the website operator to scrap the data (Hillen, 2019).
