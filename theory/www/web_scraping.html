Web scraping, a software agent, also known as a Web robot (Glez-Pe単a et al., 2013) describes the automated process of 
accessing websites and downloading specific information (Hillen, 2019, Eswari et. al., 2022), changing unstructured data 
into a structured form suitable for further analysis and storage (Glez-Pe単a et. al., 2013). These data can take the form 
of numbers, text, images, or videos (Bradley & James, 2019).

In practice, web scraping is about writing software which mimics the browsing interaction between the Web servers and the 
human. Step by step, the script imitates a web user accessing the websites to parse their contents and extract 
data (Glez-Pe単a et. al., 2013, Hillen, 2019).

It's important to be aware of legal and ethical considerations when scraping websites, avoid overloading their servers 
(Aaglave et. al., 2023), and respect the website's terms of use described in its 'robots.txt' file (Glez-Pe単a et. al., 2013). 
All these points are forward explored further.
